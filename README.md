# Transformers

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

Transformers is a highly robust and dynamic repository designed for advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This repository includes tools, scripts, and models that enable seamless integration and experimentation with transformer-based architectures.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes support for various transformer-based models for NLP tasks.
- **Benchmarking**: A dedicated `benchmark` directory for speed and accuracy testing.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Files and tools in the `i18n` directory for internationalization.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive resources in the `docs` folder.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Hands-on examples in the `notebooks` directory.
- **Code Utilities**: Helper scripts in the `utils` directory for easier integration.

## Directory Structure

- `.circleci`: CI/CD configuration files.
- `.github`: GitHub-specific workflows and issue templates.
- `benchmark`: Tools for model evaluation and performance tests.
- `docs`: Documentation covering usage, setup, and FAQs.
- `examples`: Ready-to-use scripts for common tasks.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning.
- `src`: Source code for the transformers library.
- `tests`: Unit tests to ensure code quality.
- `utils`: Utility scripts for standard operations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nodoubtz/transformers.git
   cd transformers
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Example Code
Here’s how you can get started with a pre-trained model:
```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

text = "Hello, Transformers!"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
```

### Benchmarking
Run benchmarks using the tools in the `benchmark` directory:
```bash
python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --model bert-base-uncased
```
