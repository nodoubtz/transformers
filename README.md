[![Build PR Documentation](https://github.com/nodoubtz/transformers/actions/workflows/build_pr_documentation.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nodoubtz/transformers/actions/workflows/build_pr_documentation.yml)

Transformers is a powerful library designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides pre-trained models and tools to fine-tune and deploy state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models:** Access a wide range of pre-trained transformer models.
- **Custom Fine-tuning:** Easily fine-tune models for your own datasets and use cases.
- **Easy Inference:** Perform NLP tasks such as text classification, translation, summarization, and more.
- **Extensibility:** Build custom transformer architectures and workflows.

## Installation

To install the library, use the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

## Getting Started

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started with Transformers:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a sentiment analysis pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Perform inference
result = classifier("I love using Transformers!")
print(result)
```
